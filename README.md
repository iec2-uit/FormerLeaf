# FormerLeaf

This repository is the official implementation of FormerLeaf: An Efficient Vision Transformer for Cassava Leaf Disease Detection.

## Data preparation

Download and extract Cassava Leaf Disease Dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cassava-leaf-disease-classification/data. Place the extracted dataset in the input folder. The directory structure is as follows:
```
input/cassava-leaf-disease-classification/
  train_images/
    sample.jpg
  label_num_to_disease_map.json
  train.csv
```


We provide models trained on Cassava Leaf Disease Dataset. Models can be found [here](https://github.com/iec2-uit/FormerLeaf/releases/tag/model_zoo_release).
